### Seattle Commons Map

I'm going on a [walking tour](https://crosscutfestival2019.sched.com/event/Lz3X?iframe=no# 
"Alternative History Walking Tour of the Seattle Commons") inline link. over in Seattle's 
South Lake Union in a couple weeks. It's part of the upcoming 
[Crosscut Festival](https://festival.crosscut.com "Crosscut Festival"), which looks to be 
pretty interesting. But the tour in particular touches a nerve of mine. I've been
carrying a grudge since the mid-nineties over the failure at the polls of what would
have been an absolutely terrific park right in the middle of the city. But the people of
Seattle were asked to tax themselves to raise a hundred million dollars or so to pay for
part of it, and Seattleites are notoriously allergic to that sort of thing.

Anyway, I thought it would be handy to have a little app with me, that would show the user
where he would be, roughly anyhow, where he would have been in the Seattle Commmons Park.
Eventually, I expect to develop an AR app that a user could use actually to see the
features of the park, superimposed over the less-impressive reality that we currently
find in South Lake Union. But this little simple one will at least show the user's
position in the usual way.
